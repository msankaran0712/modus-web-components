# React Workspace

This project was generated for React [v17.0.2](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1702-march-22-2021).

This React Project is a utility wrapper to help build the `@trimble-oss/modus-react-components` library.

All components in this repository are auto generated by the [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction) library.

To build a local copy of these components you can run:

`npm run build`

This can be consumed in a local react application using `npm link`
